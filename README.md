# Welcome to my very first webpage!

## First GitHub Project

This is the first project that we've pushed to a remote repository using Git and GitHub

## Technologies Used

In this project we used some simple HTML5 and CSS3 to build the project, we wrote our code using the Cloud9 IDE, and we've backed it up using Git and GitHub

Ths was the first part of the course i found difficult, the transition between repl.it and codeanywhere/github & gitpod was difficult to grasp there's still a few bugs but hopefully i can fix those.
